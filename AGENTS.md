# Agent Instructions for Jules

## Project Overview

You are continuing the development of a digital cookbook focused on Latin American cuisine, starting with Colombian recipes. The goal is to create richly detailed markdown files for each recipe, including history, instructions, a detailed nutritional analysis, and a synthesis of community tips and tricks.

## Current State

- The overall project plan is in `PLAN_SABORES_LATINOS.md`.
- The specific plan for Colombian recipes is in `dishes/colombian/COLOMBIAN_RECIPES_PLAN.md`.
- The recipe for **Bandeja Paisa** is complete and can be used as a reference for the desired final structure (`dishes/colombian/andina/bandeja_paisa/bandeja_paisa.md`).
- The base file for **Ajiaco Santafereño** has been created at `dishes/colombian/andina/ajiaco_santafereño/ajiaco_santafereño.md`.
- Initial research on the nutritional value of Ajiaco's ingredients has begun.

## Your Mission

Your primary task is to continue executing the plan outlined in `dishes/colombian/COLOMBIAN_RECIPES_PLAN.md`. You will start with task `F1-04`.

### Immediate Steps (Task F1-04 Breakdown)

1. **Complete Nutritional Research for Ajiaco**
   - **Objective**: Gather nutritional data (calories, macros, key bioactive compounds) for the main ingredients of Ajiaco Santafereño.
   - **Ingredients to research**: Papa criolla, papa pastusa, papa sabanera, guascas, pechuga de pollo, mazorca.
   - **Primary Source**: Use the official [Tabla de Composición de Alimentos Colombianos (TCAC)](https://www.icbf.gov.co/system/files/tcac_web.pdf) from the ICBF.

2. **Synthesize Community Wisdom for Ajiaco**
   - **Objective**: Research and compile common tips, tricks, and variations for making Ajiaco from cooking blogs, YouTube videos, and recipe comments.

3. **Integrate Findings into `ajiaco_santafereño.md`**
   - **Objective**: Add a new section to the Ajiaco recipe file, similar to the one in `bandeja_paisa.md`, containing the nutritional table and the synthesized community tips.

4. **Update the Plan**
   - **Objective**: Mark task `F1-04` and its sub-tasks as complete in `dishes/colombian/COLOMBIAN_RECIPES_PLAN.md`.

After completing the Ajiaco recipe, proceed with the next tasks outlined in the plan (`F1-05`, `F1-06`, etc.), following the same enrichment methodology.
