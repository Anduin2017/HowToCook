*The basic order for adding auxiliary materials is as follows: ginger first, followed by scallions and garlic, chili, then dry ingredients (star anise/Sichuan pepper/Sichuan pepper), and finally dry chili. Each step above can remove unnecessary ingredients from the queue according to the different dishes being cooked.

##Timing of Salt Release and Salt Quantity Control

*Add salt to stir fried dishes first, with salt content equal to the total weight of the ingredients multiplied by 0.9%;
