#Steaming/Stewing (using rice cooker/pressure cooker/electric pressure cooker)

##What is a pressure cooker

A pressure cooker is actually a regular pot with a lockable semi tight cover and a valve on the cover, which can be used to control the pressure inside the pot.

###Working methods

The working method of a pressure cooker is to allow steam to accumulate in the pot, increasing the pressure inside the pot. When the pressure inside the pot increases, the boiling point of water also increases, which can make the cooking temperature of food containing water exceed 100 â„ƒ.

###Advantages

*Due to the high actual cooking temperature of pressure cookers, cooking time can be significantly shortened.

##Process

*After putting the ingredients and water into the inner pot, close the lid to ensure the pot is sealed and heat it up.

###Precautions

*The steam is very hot, do not get close to the exhaust valve. **
