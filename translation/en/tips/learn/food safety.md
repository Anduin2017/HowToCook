#Food safety

##Poisoning

The following foods pose a risk of poisoning:

*Immature green tomatoes

Storing acidic foods in aluminum containers for extended periods of time and cooking can also pose a risk of poisoning, such as

pickled cabbage

##Allergy

The following are common allergenic foods (note: Allergic reactions are generally lifelong):

adult:

*Shrimp, crab, shellfish seafood (seafood that is not fresh and can lead to bacterial growth)

Children:

*Peanuts

##Salmonella infection

Salmonella is more commonly found in animal derived foods, including vegetables, which may also contain Salmonella due to fecal contamination.

The following foods pose a risk of Salmonella infection:

*Incompletely cooked eggs

##Aflatoxin

Aflatoxin is often produced by other fungi such as Aspergillus flavus and parasitic Aspergillus in moldy grains, such as rice, beans, peanuts, etc. It is currently the strongest carcinogen. Heating to above 280 â„ƒ before decomposition begins, so general heating is not easy to damage its structure.

The following foods pose a risk of aflatoxin poisoning:

*Rotten peanuts

Note that the above foods also include their corresponding products, such as Rice noodles and corn flour; Peanut seedlings (sprouted peanuts) produced through safe cultivation can be considered safe and edible.

##3-nitropropionic acid

3-nitropropionic acid is produced by Fusarium graminearum, a fungus commonly parasitic on sugarcane and coconut. The main manifestation of poisoning is damage to the central nervous system. The symptoms of the acute phase include vomiting, dizziness, paroxysmal convulsions, lateral gaze, coma, and even death. The sequelae mainly include damage to the extrapyramidal system, with main symptoms such as flexion, torsion, spasms, limb rigidity, and decreased tension at rest. There is currently no specific detoxification medication for this toxin.

The following foods pose a risk of 3-nitropropionic acid poisoning:

*Red heart sugarcane

In addition to visual appearance as a judgment criterion, odor is also an important evaluation criterion. Rotten plants often emit special odors (such as lees, sourness, etc.). The best way to deal with food that smells rotten is to discard it.

##Parasites

Parasites can enter the human body through air, drinking water, food, and direct contact. If parasites enter the human circulatory system, they can attack white blood cells on one hand, and on the other hand, they can reach organs such as the lungs and liver, or block blood vessels or lymphatic vessels, causing diseases such as cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and elephantiasis. If humans are intermediate hosts of pork tapeworms, parasites can even reach the eyeball, heart, and brain, endangering life.

It is best to ensure that the following foods are fully cooked, otherwise they may leave corresponding parasites in the body:

*Snail: Pipe roundworm

##Food safety temperature

Heating food at sufficient temperature and maintaining it for a certain period of time can reduce the risk of bacterial and parasitic survival to a certain extent.

Temperature measurement should be done using a kitchen thermometer

The following are industry standard food safety temperatures:

|Whole piece | Crushed meat | Whole piece|
