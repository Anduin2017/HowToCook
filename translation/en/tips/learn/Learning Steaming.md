#Steaming

##Method

###Steaming pot

The steamer is a multi-layer structure, with the bottom used to hold water. It uses the heat generated by the water vapor after the water boils to heat the upper layer of food.

Add an appropriate amount of water to the bottom of the steamer - place the food in the top steamer - heat the steamer over the fire

###Iron pot

If there is no steamer, only a regular iron pot (not a flat bottomed pot), you can place a tripod at the bottom of the pot and inject enough water to achieve a similar effect to a steamer.

Add sufficient water to the bottom of the iron pot - Place it on a tripod - Place the food on the tripod - Open fire and close the lid

##Precautions

*Due to the heat source being water vapor, the bottom of the food in the lower steamer may be soaked by water. You can place the steamer cloth under the food to avoid this situation. You can also use chopsticks to build a simple stand for placing food.
