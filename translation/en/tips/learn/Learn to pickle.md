#Marinate (meat)

##Attention

The pickling described here is a step in the preparation of ingredients before cooking, not in the production of finished products such as salted meat or pickled sausages

##Marinated

Marinating meat before cooking is a common method to pre flavor the meat. The general object of pickling is raw meat. According to the needs of the dishes, the size of the meat knife can be determined by oneself.

For example, fried chicken rice pudding and chicken breast meat are marinated in a bowl after being cut into small pieces the size of dice

According to the different dishes, the selected seasonings and seasonings for pickling can be of any type. Sometimes, for different tastes, auxiliary ingredients may also need to be pre processed.

##Basic concepts of pickling

This is an introduction to the normal flavor pickling process.

-Generally speaking, the larger the amount of meat (such as pickling 5kg chicken wings at once), the larger the volume (such as a whole lamb leg), and the heavier the taste, the more seasoning and auxiliary materials are needed

##Marinating techniques

-Fine shredded meat and thin sliced meat: Due to the fragility of the meat, it needs to be as gentle as possible. Fingers take on the shape of claw machine pliers, gently grabbing the marinade evenly. Then gently stir in one direction until evenly mixed

##Pickling container and time

-Choose a container that can hold ingredients and marinades. Including bowls, plates, trays, etc. At this time, it is open pickling, usually for a short time, usually 0.5-2 hours of pickling time. (Roasted) lamb legs can also be marinated in this way, but for a longer period of time

##Common marinade ingredients

-Light soy sauce: a base flavor with a sauce like aroma and a salty taste. Can be used for almost all types of meat

##Several commonly used pickling formulas

-Beef: marinate with a moderate amount of soy sauce, a small amount of cooking wine, and a small amount of white sugar. Choose salt (to supplement saltiness), oyster sauce, and a small amount of seafood sauce (oyster sauce beef), five spice powder/thirteen spice (onion stir fried beef) according to taste. Be cautious with scallions and ginger

##Practical examples of dishes

-Stir fried Beef with Onion: Taking 150g of beef per serving as an example. Beef should be sliced and tender when cooked, requiring stir frying

-Oyster sauce beef: Take 150g beef per person as an example. Beef should be sliced, and when cooked, it should have a tender and smooth texture with sufficient starch. This dish has a sweet taste and needs to be stir fried

-Five spice salt crispy chicken: Taking 150g chicken breast meat per serving as an example. Chicken should be cut into dice shapes and fried

-Honey sauce roasted chicken wings: Taking 250g boneless chicken wings per serving as an example. Several flower knives should be cut on the chicken wings to make the dish salty and sweet, but highlight the sweetness and require grilling

-Grilled salmon: Taking 200g boneless salmon fillet per person as an example. Fish should not be sliced, it needs to be baked in an oven
