#Use an air fryer

##What is an air fryer

Air fryer is an electronic cooking utensil that uses air instead of hot oil to heat food, making it cooked and achieving a frying effect without the need for oil.

###Working methods

The air fryer generates high-temperature hot air through the heater above, allowing the hot air to circulate and circulate around the food, quickly heating the food's own oil and removing moisture, creating a deep frying effect, and creating a crispy feeling similar to fried food.

###Advantages

*Since there is no need to add cooking oil, it can significantly reduce the intake of cooking oil that contains high amounts of fat and calories.

##Process

*Place the air fryer on a stable, flat, and level insulated surface.

##Precautions

*When using an air fryer, attention should be paid to setting the temperature not too high (preferably within 120 ℃, preferably not exceeding 168 ℃), and the production time should not be too long (about 10 minutes) to avoid generating too much harmful ingredient [acrylamide]（ https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%99%E7%83%AF%E9%85%B0%E8%83%BA ）.
