#Remove the fishy smell

Removing fishy smell is a process in the cooking process.

Removing fishy odor refers to removing the fishy and gamey taste from meat, seafood, and other foods through methods including but not limited to adding seasonings and blanching.

**The fishy smell is the source of flavor in certain foods, and excessive deodorization may lead to the loss of flavor in the food. **

There are various methods to remove fishy odors, and flexible choices should be made in cooking engineering.

##Means

###Add seasoning

Adding seasonings to ingredients is the simplest way to remove fishy odors. For example, for most dishes that use egg custard (such as [egg custard] (../../dishes/vegetarian dish/egg custard/egg custard. md), [tomato stir fried egg] (../../dishes/vegetable dish/tomato stir fried egg. md), salt, cooking wine, vinegar, and other seasonings can be added during the process of making egg custard to remove the fishy smell.

When cooking certain meats, spices such as Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, bay leaves, cinnamon, fennel, and chili can be added to the soup base to remove fishy odors.

The finished spicy hot pot base has an extremely rich aroma that can be added in moderation during cooking, enough to cover the fishy smell of most meats.

###Dipping sauce

Some foods still have a strong fishy smell after cooking. You can mix dipping sauce to mask the fishy smell when eating.

Common dipping materials include: vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, bean paste, sweet flour paste, sesame paste, peanut butter, fermented bean curd, salt, garlic, ginger, etc.

The combination of various dipping sauces varies from person to person, and no examples will be given here.

###Cooking pot

During the stir frying process, spices such as scallions, ginger, garlic, and dried chili can be used in the pan. The aromatic substances in spices evaporate under high temperature, which can to some extent cover the fishy smell and enhance the flavor of the dish.

###Blanching in a cold water pot

There is residual blood in certain animal based ingredients, such as chicken, pig trotters, pork ribs, etc. If residual blood is not removed, it can cause the cooked food to have a certain fishy smell.

When cold water is poured into the pot, residual blood will disperse into the water; As the temperature rises, the proteins in the blood coagulate, and the blood that was originally dispersed in the water forms foam and floats on the surface of the water. At this point, simply skim off the foam with a spoon to remove the fishy smell, and the remaining clear soup can be used as a base for stewing and cooking.

###Precautions

-When blanching, seasonings such as Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, cooking wine, scallions, etc. are often added to the pot to further enhance the effectiveness of removing fishy odors
