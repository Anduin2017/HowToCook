#Blanching water

Blanching is a cooking process, pronounced as ch ā o shu ǐ.

Blanching refers to heating the preliminary processed ingredients in a boiling water pot until they are half cooked or fully cooked, and then removing them for further cooking or seasoning.

Blanching is an indispensable process in cooking, especially for cold mixed dishes. The color, aroma, and taste of dishes, especially the color, play a crucial role.

Most vegetables and meat ingredients with a fishy smell require blanching.

##Operation

###Boil water in a boiling pot

Boiling water in a hot pot is to heat the water in the pot and then add the ingredients to the pot. Flip the pot promptly after cooking, keeping the time short and avoiding excessive heat.

This method is commonly used for plant-based ingredients such as celery, spinach, asparagus, etc. When blanching, special attention should be paid to the heat. Over time, the color will become lighter and not crispy or tender. Therefore, after putting it in the pot, when the water boils slightly, it can be removed and cooled.

-Leaf vegetables should be blanched before slicing to avoid excessive loss of nutrients.

###Blanching in a cold water pot

Blanching in a cold water pot is the process of adding ingredients and cold water to the pot simultaneously. The water should be soaked over the raw materials and then boiled to make them mature and facilitate further processing.

Potatoes, carrots, and other vegetables require longer cooking time due to their large size and difficulty in ripening.

Some animal based ingredients, such as white meat, beef tripe, beef belly collar, etc., are also further processed after being heated and matured in cold water. Some animal based ingredients used for making soup also need to be boiled in cold water. During the heating process, nutrients gradually overflow, making the soup taste delicious. If a hot water pot is used, it will cause protein coagulation.

-The amount of water added to the pot should not be too much, so as to submerge the raw materials.

##Additional precautions

-Blanching water can sometimes cause some unstable and soluble nutrients in the raw materials to overflow, especially the water-soluble vitamins in fresh vegetables are more easily lost

###Blanching of meat

-After blanching the meat ingredients in boiling water, they can change color. After removing them and draining the water, they can proceed to the next step of cooking.

###Blanching of vegetables

-When washing vegetables, sprinkle some salt in clean water to remove any insects from the vegetables
