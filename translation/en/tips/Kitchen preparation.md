##Choose oil

Before choosing oil, it is necessary to understand some basic knowledge of fatty acids

###Classification of fatty acids

Fatty acids are divided into:

*Saturated fatty acids (avoid as much as possible)

Saturated fatty acids will be solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fatty acids will be liquid at room temperature.

###Avoidant fatty acids

Among them, saturated fatty acids and trans fatty acids are generally considered unhealthy.

Saturated fatty acids increase the risk of obesity, high cholesterol, and heart disease.

Research has shown that long-term excessive consumption of hydrogenated trans fatty acids can cause abnormal blood lipid metabolism in the human body, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Some studies also show that it may increase the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.

The World Health Organization recommends that in order to improve cardiovascular health, trans fatty acids in the diet should be controlled as much as possible, with a maximum intake not exceeding 1% of total energy. That is to say, if calculated based on an average daily energy intake of 2000 kcal per adult, the daily intake of trans fatty acids should not exceed 2.2 grams.

GB 28050-2011 stipulates that when food ingredients contain or use hydrogenated and/or partially hydrogenated fats and oils in the production process, the content of trans fats (acids) should also be indicated in the nutrition table.

###Trans fatty acids in food

According to relevant surveys, the average content of trans fatty acids in baked goods (pastries, biscuits, bread, etc.), seasonings, and fried foods is between 0.30-0.50 g/100g.

Therefore, there is no need to worry too much - trans fatty acids in daily food are not enough to harm health. But just in case, when choosing snacks, you may want to pay attention to the content of trans fats (acids) indicated in the nutrition chart.

###Trans fatty acids in cooking

According to a 2021 survey, the average content of trans fatty acids in vegetable oils in China is 0.86 g/100g, so there is no need to worry too much.

An additional source of trans fatty acids to note is the cooking process:

Plant oils often contain a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have poor thermal stability and are easily converted into trans fats at high temperatures.

Therefore, in different scenarios, we need to choose oil products reasonably and minimize the heating time of oil products as much as possible.

###Selection of vegetable oil

|Oil product name | Saturated fatty acids (%) | Omega 3 (%) | Omega 6 (%) | Omega 9 (%)|

*Peanut oil is rich in monounsaturated fats. But it is only recommended to choose high-quality ones. During processing, it is also important to avoid heating for too long to prevent the formation of trans fatty acids.

Therefore, based on the above table, we can draw some conclusions:

*No oil is perfect, every oil has its advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, we should choose different oils according to different cooking scenarios.

####Stir fried vegetable oil

*Peanut oil (choose high oil quality)

Peanut oil, olive oil, and rapeseed oil contain more unsaturated fatty acids and less saturated fatty acids. However, its thermal stability is poor and it is prone to producing trans fatty acids during the heating process. Therefore, it is important to control the heating time and avoid heating for too long.

####Frying oil

*Coconut oil

When stir frying or deep frying, it is necessary to use oils with better thermal stability, such as coconut oil, palm oil, and butter. They produce fewer trans fatty acids. However, they have a high content of saturated fatty acids and are not suitable for long-term consumption.

####Cold mixed, stewed with oil

*Flaxseed oil

This type of scenario does not require heating, therefore it does not produce trans fatty acids. Do not choose oil products with too many saturated fatty acids.
