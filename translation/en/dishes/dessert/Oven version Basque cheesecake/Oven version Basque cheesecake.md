#The recipe for the oven version of Basque cheesecake

! [Homemade] (./Oven version Basque cheesecake. jpg)

The reason why the finished product does not have a black top like the pictures online is because the oven does not have functions such as hot air/only upper tube heating. If these functions are available, hot air can be used for coloring.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

##Essential materials and tools

-Cream cheese: 212g (this is the mass of one piece, relatively convenient, the original tutorial was 250g)

Optional (chocolate flavor)

-Chocolate: 38g (only try melting regular chocolate, add and stir evenly in the light cream step)

##Calculate

The following materials are baked using a 7-inch circular mold, while the original tutorial used a 6-inch circular mold.

##Operation

-Cream cheese softened, microwave for 10s+10s.

##Additional content

-It is normal for the finished product to shake after coming out of the oven, but the taste is not the best after cooling. It must be refrigerated to taste good!
