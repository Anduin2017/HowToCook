#The recipe for basic milk bread

! [Milk Bread Finished Product] (./1-1 Finished Product. jpg)

Bread is a common staple food. Ordinary bread requires a long period of fermentation and kneading. But this recipe has simplified the preparation steps as much as possible, making it easy for beginners to get started, and ensuring its flavor as much as possible. Of course, those with higher requirements can also refer to their bread recipes.

This recipe requires a lot of additional tools, which will be detailed in later chapters.

This recipe is designed for * * baking beginners * *, with a moderate difficulty level * *, and an estimated production time of * * 200 minutes * *.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★★★

##Essential materials and tools

###Required raw materials

-High gluten or medium gluten flour * (Try to use high gluten flour, but avoid using low gluten flour * *. All "universal flour" without special instructions are medium gluten flour)*

###Necessary tools

-Oven * (* * Do not use an oven without temperature control * *)*

###Introduction to optional materials, tools, and materials/tools

##Calculate

**Note: Although the specific amount of raw materials is given, indoor temperature, indoor humidity, and even the content of yeast in the air can affect the production process. This recipe will provide adjustment suggestions as much as possible during the production process. **

Cup is a commonly used baking measurement unit because it can be easily converted between volume and weight.  1 cup = 250 ml ， Generally, 1 cup of flour equals 120 g. For more conversions, please refer to the attached content.

Here, use cups for larger quantities and g for smaller quantities.

Each one:

-* * Fermentation Head**

##Operation

###Production of fermentation heads

The fermentation head is a product of pre fermentation. Through pre fermentation, not only can the success rate be improved, but a longer fermentation time will also enhance the flavor of the bread. If conditions permit, the fermentation head should be fermented for 4 days to achieve the best flavor. But for beginners, the finished product presented by a 30 minute fermentation starter is already quite impressive. Next, make the fermentation head.

Firstly, mix the yeast and * * * 30 ℃ warm water * * * evenly with a scraper or kitchen utensil, and let it stand for 5 minutes. Then mix with flour and stir evenly. At this point, the fermenting head should be a particularly viscous batter.

2. Cover the batter with a cloth and place it in a warm place for fermentation for 45-60 minutes.

The final batter should have many bubbles on the surface and a significant increase in volume.

**Fermentation failed? Take a look here:**

>1. Confirm that the yeast has not expired

**How to make a 'permanent' fermentation head? **

>With yeast, baking bread anytime is no longer a dream! The 'permanent' fermentation head can be made according to the following method:

###The production of dough

With the yeast head, half of the success is achieved!

1. Mix and stir the remaining ingredients with the fermentation head using a scraper. When stirring, be sure to scrape the wall to ensure thorough mixing. When forming dough without dry powder, press the dough with one clean and dry hand, and hold the container with the other hand to form a large dough. Then pour it onto a panel or silicone pad for operation

>At this point, the ground mass should have already formed and is relatively soft. If it cannot form and is very sticky, it indicates that there is less flour. You can add ¼ cup of flour and stir thoroughly again until it forms. If the dough has formed or there is a lot of dry powder, it means that the kneading time is not enough. At this point, the kneading time can be increased.

2. Use the lower part of your palm to push the dough open, then fold it in half and push it open again until there are no dry powder lumps on the surface. At this point, the dough is not yet very smooth.

>If the panel is used during this process, there may be a small amount of adhesion, which can be scraped off with a scraper or knife.

3. Use a spray bottle to spray a layer of vegetable oil onto a container that is at least three times the size of the current dough (or evenly spread by hand), place the dough in and cover it with a cloth, and let it ferment for 1 hour.

>If there is a problem with fermentation, please refer to the solution for fermentation failure under the production of fermentation heads.

At this point, the dough should be twice as big as before. Sprinkle a thin layer of flour on the panel or silicone pad (you can see the thickness of the panel or silicone pad), then take out the dough and deflate it with your hand to release air.

>You can spray a layer of oil evenly on the baking tray or apply a thin layer of butter before placing silicone oil paper on top. This way, the silicone paper won't move freely.

Fermentation in trays or molds for 30 to 45 minutes.

>If there is a problem with fermentation, please refer to the solution for fermentation failure under the production of fermentation heads.

At the same time, preheat the oven.

>Preheat the oven: Set the oven to the highest temperature and bake it in the air for at least 20 minutes.

10. Use scissors or knives to cut a few gaps on the bread as the pattern.

11. Put it in the oven and bake it for 30 minutes at 180 ℃, then adjust it to 165 ℃ and bake it for 10 minutes.

>The temperature of different ovens varies. During the baking process, observe the bread. If there is no obvious discoloration after 30 minutes, then the temperature is too low. At this point, increase the temperature by 5-10 ℃ or bake for 5-10 minutes more

After cooling, put it in a food bag and store it for one week. Freezing can store for one month.

>After being sealed in a food bag for one night, the bread will further soften inside and on the surface. So the best time to taste it is the next morning.

2. How to save excess bread

Bread slices can be frozen and left at room temperature to warm up for the next use, or heated directly. But * * never put it in the refrigerated area! **The moisture of bread in the refrigerated area will quickly dissipate.

3. Recommended way of consumption

! [Finished product] (./5-1 finished product. jpg)

a. Take a large piece of bread and split it in half. Heat over low heat in a pan (usually no oil is needed, but if you want crispy crust, you can apply butter on the surface of the bread before frying and baking) for 1-2 minutes.
