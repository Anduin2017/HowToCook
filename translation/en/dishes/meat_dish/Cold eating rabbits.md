In the sixth step of the operation, it should be noted that the oil level should submerge the rabbit meat. If it is not submerged, it needs to be replenished in a timely manner.

In the 7th step of the operation, it should be noted that chili peppers are extremely easy to fry and the batter will turn black. This process is very fast, so it is necessary to reduce the heat and wait until there is not much water vapor evaporating before adding rabbit meat.
