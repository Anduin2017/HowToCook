#The recipe for steak

! [Finished steak] (./steak. jpg)

Steak is a popular Western meat dish that is rich in protein, oil, and minerals such as iron and zinc. The cooking process of steak is controlled by flexible cooking techniques such as frying, grilling, slow cooking, and maturation, ranging from medium rare (pink in the center) to fully cooked (fully cooked). High temperature cooking can form a burnt aroma shell, which can be paired with salt, garlic, butter, and spices to obtain rich flavors. The basics of steak cooking are relatively simple, but mastering them is difficult. This article mainly introduces the simplest fried steak, the entire cooking process takes 15-30 minutes. The picture shows short ribs of 5% cooked beef.

##Essential materials and tools

-Flat bottomed pan (recommended cast iron flat bottomed pan if conditions permit)

##Calculate

Before each production, it is necessary to determine how many plans to make. One serving is enough for two people to eat.

Each one:

-Beef steak 450-500g (two slices)

##Operation

###Material preparation

1. Remove the steak from the refrigerator and thaw it.

-If the steak is frozen, it should be transferred to the refrigerator one night in advance and left at room temperature half an hour before cooking.

2. Wash the small tomatoes, potatoes, and mushrooms, cut them in half and set aside.

-For naked eye steak (see [How to choose different types of steak])（ https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/72352426 ））Insert kitchen scissors vertically into the connective tissue at the center of the naked eye steak and make 1-2 cuts. This is because the "naked eye" of the steak (i.e. this connective tissue) will contract violently at high temperatures, causing the steak to deform and making it difficult to heat evenly.

###Cooking

Note: This process is suitable for making 2-3cm thick, 5-7 mature steaks. If you prefer different degrees of ripeness, consider increasing or shortening the frying time for the first half by 20-30% based on this.

1. Turn on the stove to high heat (see Appendix for instructions on heat intensity), and add olive oil to the pot. Heat the pot for 15-30 seconds.

-For sirloin steak and fillet steak, you need to use chopsticks or a spatula to stand the steak upright and fry its sides for about 30 seconds.

7. Switch the stove to medium heat, then quickly add butter, garlic, and thyme in order. Use a spatula to quickly spread butter in the pot until it is completely melted. Press garlic under the steak to enhance its flavor.

-You can determine the current heat by observing the state of the oil dripping onto the surface of the steak. If the oil bubbles when poured on the steak and the color of the oil does not turn dark brown, then the oil temperature is appropriate.

10. Remove the steak and place it on a cutting board, wrap it in tin foil, and wait for 5-10 minutes. The function of this process (called waking meat) is to use the temperature of the steak itself to continue heating and lock in moisture.

###Control of Fire Temperature

Frying steak is the art of controlling the heat. Due to space limitations, here are some quantitative methods for evaluating firepower and the terms related to fire used in this article.

###About seasoning

The seasoning of steak does not necessarily need to follow the specifications in this guide. Generally speaking, garlic, black pepper, and butter are necessary, but if you don't like the taste of lip shaped plants such as rosemary or thyme, you are free to try other steak seasonings for seasoning. There are also various barbecue seasoning salts available on the market for selection. The author once discovered a combination of Chinese and Western methods, which involves cutting open the chili peppers and adding garlic slices to olive oil for frying, and then pouring them over the steak as a seasoning, creating a unique flavor.
