#The recipe for braised dishes

Lu Cai is a classic Chinese braised dish that is rich in protein and various vitamins. The meat is tender and juicy, with a fragrant aroma. The degree of flavor can be adjusted according to the soaking time. This dish is suitable as a cold dish, a side dish, or a staple food. The brine can also be used multiple times, and the more aged it is, the more fragrant it becomes.
