#The method of making fragrant dried shredded meat

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★

##Essential materials and tools

*Pork tenderloin (you can buy pre cut and weighed shredded meat from the supermarket)

##Calculate

Before each production, it is necessary to determine how many plans to make. One serving is enough for one person to consume

Total amount:

*Xianggan=portion size * 75g

Using the above conditions, calculate the proportion of raw materials planned to be used.

##Operation

###Preparation work

*Cut the shredded meat (without shredded meat, cut it yourself) and mix 3ml of soy sauce and cornstarch evenly for later use.

###Start the pot

*Clean the pot with 15ml of oil. Do not wait for the oil to heat up before pouring in shredded meat and slowly spreading it. Once the shredded meat is cooked, immediately remove it and leave the oil in the pot.

Note that different pots or stoves can affect the stir frying time. It is recommended to try it if you are unsure if it is cooked.
