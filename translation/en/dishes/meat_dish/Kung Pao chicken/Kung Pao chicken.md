Using the above conditions, calculate the proportion of raw materials planned to be used and adjust according to taste.

##Operation

###Simplified version

-Use scissors to remove the bones from the pistol legs, tap the chicken surface with the back of the knife, cut into strips, and cut into 1.5cm square diced meat; Soak in clean water for 10 minutes, remove and let dry for later use (if chicken breast meat is available, it can be directly diced and processed afterwards)

###A slightly more complex but more mouth watering version

Compared to the simple version, it is more recommended to use Erjingtiao and raw peanuts here. And it added lettuce to complement the crispy peanuts and the soft chicken

-Peel and cut lettuce into small pieces measuring 1cm square, set aside for later use;
