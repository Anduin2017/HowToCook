-Red onions and chopped garlic for later use

##Additional content

-For the process of cutting pork belly into strips, the definition is: the pork belly with its skin facing upwards is placed on the table, and the plane where the skin is located is the plane formed by its length and width. The plane perpendicular to this plane is the height. The final effect of meat strips is a slender strip with alternating fat and lean. (Note: The meat strips here must be thin, with a smaller length and width. Thin meat strips are easier to stew and make soft and sticky.).
