##Calculate

Each one:

*Main ingredients: 1kg pig skin, 4kg water

##Operation

-Chop the pigskin into small pieces not exceeding 10cm, soak them in clean water for 12 hours, then put them in cold water, add 10g of ginger and 50ml of cooking wine, blanch for 5-10 minutes, remove and put them in cold water

##Additional content

-When operating, it is important to note that when making pig skin jelly, boiling it directly in the pot will "waste" it, which is also the most taboo. It is necessary to constantly rub and wash the pig skin with white vinegar and salt to ensure that the cooked pig skin is crystal clear and has no fishy smell
