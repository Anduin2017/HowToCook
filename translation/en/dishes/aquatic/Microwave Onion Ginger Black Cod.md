#Microwave method for making scallion, ginger, black cod

This dish is adapted from the recipe of Margaret Lu, the mother of Johnny Zhu, the head chef of Veil restaurant in Seattle. Ms. Lu's original recipe was to use tilapia for this dish, but Johnny changed it to cod. However, she can also use flounder fillet, sea bass, trout, etc. The density of each fish varies, and the cooking time needs to be fine tuned.
