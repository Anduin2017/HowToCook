The shrimp we usually see can only turn red after going to the "soup" and dancing in the "fire"! Argentine shrimp are very stubborn, once they become red, they become red for a lifetime! Like its relatives living in the Arctic, the Arctic shrimp is naturally red.

Argentine red shrimp is so red because it lives in the deep sea, which makes its body rich in trace elements such as iodine, phosphorus, and precious astaxanthin, which can enhance the human immune system and have an important regulatory effect on heart activity, reducing the cholesterol content in the blood.

Argentine red shrimp is not only plump and delicious, but the shrimp meat is as white as condensed fat, delicate and smooth, with a fresh and tender taste, and a sweet and fragrant aroma. It is the darling of the shrimp cuisine industry. It looks really delicious and makes people salivate. Come and enjoy the pleasure of indulging!
