#The recipe for stir frying crab with curry

The first time I had curry stir fried crab was at Jianxing Restaurant in Thailand. The crab with crispy meat was covered in curry with a crab yellow flavor, and the taste was really amazing. Programmers who love seafood must not miss it. Easy to operate and very friendly to coastal programmers.
