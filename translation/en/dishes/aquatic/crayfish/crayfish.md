##Additional content

Restaurants usually deep fry once. If you fry at home, it's too wasteful, so in this recipe, you use more oil than stir fry to fry, and it's just as delicious after testing.

The shrimp meat after removing the shrimp line has a slightly worse taste than the shrimp meat without removing the shrimp line, and removing the shrimp line from crayfish is a challenge for beginners. If they can accept the shrimp line, they can also choose not to remove it.
