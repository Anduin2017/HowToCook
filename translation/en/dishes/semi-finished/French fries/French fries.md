french fries 🍟 It's a type of potato 🥔\ potato 🥔\ potato 🥔 Fast food made by cutting into strips and then frying (which may not be considered fast food in some countries) is very suitable. Compared to deep frying, air fryers may be easier to avoid crashes and achieve asynchronous non blocking. Compared to cutting potatoes by hand, washing away starch, and spraying oil, using semi-finished French fries may significantly reduce calorie consumption before calorie intake. Rounding them up will significantly reduce calorie consumption before calorie intake.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

##Operation

###Kaifeng french fries

-Pay attention to keeping the opening small when opening large quantities of semi-finished French fries in Kaifeng, which can effectively reduce frost on the surface of the fries during long-term storage.

###Preheating air fryer

-Plug in and preheat at 200 ℃ for 5 minutes.

###French fries

-Take out the French fries and place them in an air fryer at 200 ℃ for 20 minutes.

###Brittle (optional)

-At 10-15 minutes, take out the pot and spray a layer of oil with an area of 2/3 of the surface area of the dried French fries.

###Remove and load the tray

-For those who like crispy French fries, take them out and dance with the pot to let the air pass through the surface of the fries before putting them on a plate; I like the direct plating of soft fries. It is better to use dipping sauce or pour sauce over it.

-Tomato sauce, egg yolk sauce, honey mustard sauce, garlic sauce (.../../condition/garlic sauce. md)... The path to advancement for French fries lies in exploring sauces and their combinations.
