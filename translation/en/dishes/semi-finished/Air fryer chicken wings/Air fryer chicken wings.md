#Method for making chicken wings in an air fryer

! [Chicken Wings] (./Chicken Wings _. jpg)

Air fryer is convenient for making chicken wings, as the food with its own oil and fat tastes better than KFC's, and you don't have to wash the dishes after eating.

-Cooking time: 40 minutes (preparation for 3 minutes+thawing for 20 minutes+cooking for 17 minutes)

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

##Essential materials and tools

-Essential: In chicken wings (recommended to buy Tyson's Orleans chicken wings, JD offers discounts of over 30 bags of 454g, approximately 12 pieces). I have also bought from Shangxian and Shengnong, but it's not as convenient. Tyson's is marinated, but if you have time, you can buy one that hasn't been marinated and marinate it yourself. ）

##Calculate

-6 chicken wings in total (Tyson Orleans chicken wings, other brands such as Saint Nong Dodo wings may be larger, please consider according to your appetite)

##Operation

-Take the chicken wings out of the refrigerator, place them face down in a tin foil baking tray, sprinkle with chopped basil, cover with plastic wrap, and thaw naturally for 20 minutes

##Additional content

-Recommend purchasing an air fryer with good temperature control, otherwise it may become burnt
