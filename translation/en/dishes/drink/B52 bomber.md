#The method of B52 bomber

B-52 is a unique type of cocktail that requires a short straw, napkin, and lighter.

Ignite the wine, drink it in one breath with a straw, and then you can experience the feeling of being cold first and then hot, like a world of ice and fire. That feeling is only known after trying it out.

Using a straw is suitable for women, and the most stimulating way to drink is to take a sip. When drinking, be careful not to touch the cup mouth and cause burns. Let the fire extinguish in your mouth in order to taste the best.
