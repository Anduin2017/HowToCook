Milk tea is a simple and easy to make beverage. Generally, beginners only need 30 minutes to complete it.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

##Essential materials and tools

-Bag steeped black tea (recommended Lipton Yellow Label Selected Black Tea)

##Calculate

Each one:

-2 bags of bagged black tea (approximately 4g)

##Operation

-Take 2 bags of brewed black tea and place them in a cup. Add 180-200mL of boiling water.

##Additional content

-After adding boiling water, try to keep the inside of the cup warm, such as using a cup with a smaller opening or covering it with a lid. If measuring with a measuring cup when the temperature is low may cause the boiling water to cool before being poured into the black tea, then the volume can be estimated directly without using a measuring cup.
