Bai Zhuo Cai Xin is a classic Cantonese dish. Bai Zhuo is a cooking technique in Cantonese cuisine that uses boiling water or soup to heat raw food until cooked, known as Bai Zhuo. This cooking technique can maintain the original freshness, and is commonly used in Cantonese cuisine to cook shrimp and vegetables.

##Essential materials and tools

-Fresh vegetable hearts

##Calculate

The following amount is enough for two people to eat, and one person can eat it directly with rice.

-Fresh vegetable heart 250g

##Operation

1. Wash the vegetable heart and remove any hard or old areas from the roots. I also used a knife to scrape off the root and stem parts of the cabbage here, removing the harder layer on the outside. The inside of the cabbage is more delicious, but be careful not to burn the roots for too long. If the time is too long, the roots will not become brittle

2. Cut garlic into minced garlic and add some onions along with onions

3. Mix soul sauce: 5g soy sauce, 5g oyster sauce, 3g sugar, and 100g water in half a bowl to make a sauce

4. Boil a pot of 500ml water with 5g salt and 10g cooking oil

5. Heat the roots and stems of the cabbage in boiling water for 1 minute until they turn dark green in color. Heat the entire vegetable heart in the pot for 1 minute, then scoop it up and place it on a plate

6. Open another small pot and pour in the mixed sauce. Bring to a boil over low heat, add half of the minced garlic, a little ginger shred, and chopped millet pepper. A little chopped onion and garlic were added during the production process. First, oil was poured into the bottom of the pot, and after it was 50% hot, minced garlic and onion were poured in. After slightly frying until fragrant, the sauce was added, and then chili pepper was added and boiled

7. Collect the sauce slightly, wait for about ten seconds after boiling, and then pour it directly on the cabbage, not too much, but the garlic is very awesome, not too little
