Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★

##Essential materials and tools

-Eggplant

##Calculate

Before each production, it is necessary to determine how many plans to make. One serving is enough for 1-2 people to eat

Total amount:

-The quantity of eggplants is equal to the number of servings multiplied by 1.8 pieces

>Note: Oil and soy sauce are also reflected in the operation, and you can cross compare them to determine the amount of added materials

##Operation

-Wash the eggplant and divide it into two sections (vertically cut) with one knife. Cut each eggplant into diamond shaped pieces and place them in a bowl for later use.

##Additional content

-Due to the soy sauce, there is no need to add salt to this dish. Before serving, you can taste it. If it's not salty, you can add a small amount of salt. The next time you stir fry, the amount of soy sauce should be increased
