Before each production, it is necessary to determine how many plans to make. One serving is just enough for one person to eat.

Each one:

-1 cucumber (about 200g)

##Operation

-Wash the cucumber thoroughly, cut it into semi-circular slices, and set aside for later use

##Additional content

-Ham is salty, so it should be added after seasoning to prevent the ham from getting salt on it too
