##Essential materials and tools

-Xiaomi

##Calculate

-Xiaomi 100g

Using the above conditions, calculate the proportion of raw materials planned to be used.

##Operation

*100g of Xiaomi, put it in a bowl, gently rinse with water (stir by hand, pour out the water, only remove the floating dust outside, do not scrub!!!)

##Additional content

*This is cooked in a regular pot (only takes 30-35 minutes to remove from the pot), with the best taste. Pressure cookers and rice cookers are convenient, but their effectiveness decreases. The amount of water should be reduced appropriately, usually 100 grams of millet+1800 grams of water
